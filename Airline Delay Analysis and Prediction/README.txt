Project Title :-   Airline Delay Analysis and Prediction

Technologies :- Pyspark, Spark MLib, AWS (EC2,S3,IAM, EMR, Redshift/Snowflake/Hive, QuickSight, Apache Airflow) 

Description :-

Flight delay is a serious and widespread problem across the world. Increasing flight delays 
place a significant strain on the air travel system. Every year 20% of airline flights are cancelled or delayed,
costing passengers more than 20 billion dollars in money and their time. 
Our goal is to use exploratory analysis and machine learning models to predict 
airline departure and arrival delays by building a data pipeline on AWS.
